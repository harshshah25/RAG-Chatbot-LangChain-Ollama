# RAG-Chatbot-LangChain-Ollama
Retrieval Augmented Generation is a powerful paradigm in Natural Language Processing that combines the strengths of retrieval-based and generation-based models to enhance the performance of conversational agents.

# Architecture of RAG Chatbot:
The RAG Chatbot is built using a hybrid architecture that combines retrieval and generation components. The architecture consists of the following key modules:

**1. Retrieval Module:** This module is responsible for retrieving relevant information from a large knowledge base using the Ollama framework. It takes the user's query as input and retrieves the most relevant passages from the knowledge base.

**2. Generation Module:**: The generation module generates responses based on the retrieved passages and the user's query. It utilises LangChain's capabilities for natural language generation to produce coherent and contextually relevant responses.

**Vector Database used:** ChromaDB

**Deployed on:** Streamlit
